# Minesweeper-AI

### What Is This?
This was an assignment for an AI-related class at UCI in Spring 2020. The goal was to create some kind of AI to play minesweeper and achieve certain success rates of various boards of increasing difficulty. The AI only knew the size of the board, the number of mines, and the outcome of its previous move. Thus, it has to track the board itself and make all decisions based on this limited amount of information.

### Why Is It All One File?
All code had to be contained within a single file. I would have rather split it up among multiple modules, but this was the assignment specification.

### Why Am I Uploading It Now?
I'm uploading previous coding projects that show how I code and how my coding style has changed over the years.
